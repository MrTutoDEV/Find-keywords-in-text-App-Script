# Find-keywords-in-text-App-Script
This is a google app script that works with Google documents
It searches for all the keywords inside of a text(e.g = To make it easier to grade an essay, etc.)

I made this script for my Business IB teacher to help him grade the Internal Assesments(IA) and find all the Business terms inside of the essay.
